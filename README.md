## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers: Running the Script Manually  

If you want to use the Python script directly **(instead of using the compiled executable)**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/exif-photo-organizer.git
cd exif-photo-organizer
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies using Poetry**
```bash
poetry install
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script**
```bash
poetry run python update_exif.py
```

By default, the script **modifies images in the current directory**.

### **Optional: Using a `.env` file for a Custom Folder**
If you want to specify a different folder for development, you can use a `.env` file.

#### **Steps to set it up:**
1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. **Edit `.env` and set the correct path** to your photos directory:
   ```ini
   IMAGE_FOLDER=/Users/yourusername/path/to/photos
   ```
3. **Save the file.**

If no `.env` file is present, the script will default to using the **current directory** where it is executed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building a Standalone Executable

If you want to create a **buildable package** that runs without Python installed, you can use **PyInstaller**.

### **Steps to Build:**

1. **Ensure PyInstaller is installed**:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create the standalone executable**:
   ```bash
   poetry run pyinstaller --onefile --name exif-photo-organizer-${{ runner.os }} update_exif.py
   ```

3. **Locate the built executable**:
   - On **Mac**, the file will be:
     ```bash
     ./dist/exif-photo-organizer-mac
     ```
   - On **Windows**, it will be:
     ```powershell
     dist\exif-photo-organizer-win.exe
     ```
   - On **Linux**, it will be:
     ```bash
     ./dist/exif-photo-organizer-linux
     ```

4. **Run the generated executable**:
   ```bash
   ./dist/exif-photo-organizer-mac  # Mac
   ./dist/exif-photo-organizer-linux  # Linux
   ```
   ```powershell
   dist\exif-photo-organizer-win.exe  # Windows
   ```

Now users can run the tool **without needing to install Python** by downloading the pre-built executable.
